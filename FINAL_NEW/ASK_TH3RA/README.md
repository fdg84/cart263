Multiple Commands + Variables in Commands

For my final project ASK TH3RA, I am exploring the realm of online therapeutic services, and the use of AI for astrological wellness cults. By using a speech bot to answer the playerâ€™s questions, they will encounter a series of strange responses, guiding them in the wrong spiritual direction. After 5 levels of preliminary questions, the AI therapist discloses its results and advises the player depending on their individual prescription. As the player selects elements vocally, the therapist bot responds with a randomized array of phrases. The focus of the game is to confuse the player instead of actually helping them during their spiritual quest. 

Thank you and enjoy!
