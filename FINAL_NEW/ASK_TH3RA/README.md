Multiple Commands + Variables in Commands

For my final project ASK TH3RA, I am exploring the realm of online therapeutic services, and the use of AI for astrological wellness cults. By using a speech bot to answer the playerâ€™s questions, they will encounter a series of strange responses, guiding them in the wrong spiritual direction. After 5 levels of preliminary questions, the AI therapist discloses its results and advises the player depending on their individual prescription. The game includes multiple actions, consisting of interactive speech and sounds. As the player selects elements vocally, the therapist bot responds with a randomized array of phrases and audio clips, activating on screen animations. The focus of the game is to confuse the player instead of actually helping them during their spiritual quests. 

It takes a second for the speech recognizer to activate properly on my computer, so please be patient when starting the program. Thank you and enjoy!
