# VOICE ACTIVATED AUDIO
## Francis Ouellette

Inspired by Pippin Barr
Multiple Commands + Variables in Commands

For the Voice Jam exercise, I used the speech recognizer to display a series of voice activated words, changing the colors and playing audio snippets of music I created. There is also an extra phrase that can be spoken by the speech-bot, when saluted correctly. 

One important detail: it takes a bit for the recognizer to activate properly on my computer, so please be patient when starting the program. Thank you and enjoy!
